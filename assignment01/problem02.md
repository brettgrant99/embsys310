Why use two's compliment?

There are many reasons to use two's compliment.
1. Uses only 1 bit to indicate a negative number.
2. Derived from well known mathmatical properties.
3. Allows math operations to be the same on signed and unsigned numbers.
4. This is really the same as #3, but abstracts sign values away from computer hardware.
